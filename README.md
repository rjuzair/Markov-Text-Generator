# Text-extraction-generator-script

This a small program that doubles as a somewhat reusable module and a command-line
script. It will read a text file and produce some simple statistics about the contents, along with data that can be
used to create a crude Markov text generator. The main focus is on Python as a scripting language, program
structure and naming, and the usage of proper data structures.
